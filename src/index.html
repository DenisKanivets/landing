                        <b>APA</b> citation format is used mainly in the field of social sciences. It explains how to
                        handle
                        references to both published and unpublished sources, covering various forms of in-text

                        There are several reasons why you should stick to <b>APA</b> formatting. Firstly, even if you
                        paraphrase
                        someone else's ideas instead of quoting directly, it can be regarded as plagiarism. This may be
                        construed as a breach of ethical norms and lead to serious consequences - at the least, you
                        won't
                        get a
                        good mark for the work you have stolen from someone. Secondly, by having you write term papers
                        and
                        essays, your instructors test your academic writing skills. And why would any teacher give you a
                        good
                        grade if you show your ignorance of the academic formatting rules? Besides, in your post-college
                        years,
                        you may have to publish your scientific studies and articles in journals, which simply refuse to
                        print
                        incorrectly formatted manuscripts. So, now you have a good chance to learn things which can help

                        But why would anyone need an APA format citation maker? If you wonder about this, then it is
                        likely
                        that
                        you have not even opened the APA guide. If you take a look at the publication manual, you will
                        find
                        out
                        that you should be aware of different ways of citing depending on the source of information and
                        many
                        other factors. It takes some time and effort, while an APA reference generator can save you
                        both,
                        having
                        the work done for you.

                        In order to use our APA citation generator, you just need to enter some basic data about your
                        source
                        and
                        choose the source type. After that, the system will provide you with a correctly formatted
                        reference,
                        which you can copy and paste into your work. Fast and simple, yet very effective. That is really
                        helpful
                        and time-saving, especially because you get references based on the latest edition of the APA
                        publication manual for free.
